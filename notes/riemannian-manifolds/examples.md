TODO: this page will have examples of riemannian manifolds, including the derivation of the riemannian metric when necessary. However, the plan will be for each individual to have its separate page (sphere, hyperbolic space, euclidean space, etc.) consisting of *all* computations (metric, cristoffel symbols, geodesics, etc.) and this page will include the metric part of each.
