## Intermediate Value Property

#### Definition

Take a function \\(f: [a,b] \mapsto \mathbb{F}\\) where \\(\mathbb{F}\\) is an ordered field and \\([a,b] \subset \mathbb{F}\\). Let \\(J \subset \mathbb{F}\\) denote the closed interval with endpoints \\(f(a)\\) and \\(f(b)\\). Then, \\(f\\) is said to have the _intermediate value property_ if for any \\(y \in J\\) there exists \\(x \in [a,b]\\) such that \\(f(x) = y\\).
