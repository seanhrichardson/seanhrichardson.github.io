## Cauchy Sequences

#### Definition in the Reals
A sequence \\((a_k)\\) over the reals is called _Cauchy_ if for any positive number \\(\varepsilon\\), there exists a natural number \\(N\\) such that for all \\(m,n > N\\) we have \\(|a_m-a_n| < \varepsilon\\).

#### Definition for any Metric Space
Take a metric space \\(M\\) with metric \\(d\\). A sequence \\((a_k)\\) with elements in \\(M\\) is called _Cauchy_ if for any positive number \\(\varepsilon\\), there exists a natural number \\(N\\) such that for all \\(m,n > N\\) we have \\(d(a_m,a_n) < \varepsilon\\).
