## Metric Space

#### Definition
A set \\(S\\) together with a function \\(d: S \times S \mapsto \mathbb{R}\\) is called a _metric space_ if the following conditions hold.
- \\(d(x,y) = 0\\) if and only if \\(x = y\\).
- Symmetry: \\(d(x,y) = d(y,x)\\) for all \\(x,y \in S\\)
- The triangle inequality: \\(d(x,y) + d(y,z) \geq d(x,z)\\).
