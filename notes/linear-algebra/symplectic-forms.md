## Symplectic Forms

Symplectic geometry studies smooth manifolds equipped with a "symplectic form", which is a (closed) \\(2\\)-form \\(\omega\\) such that the induced map \\(\widehat{\omega}_p: T\_pM \to T^*\_pM\\) defined by \\(\widehat{\omega}_p(v) = v\ \lrcorner\ \omega\_p\\) is a linear isomorphism. On each tangent space, therefore, we are studying the following structure.

**Def. (symplectic form)** A 2-form \\(\omega\\) on a finite dimensional vector space \\(V\\) is *symplectic* if the induced map \\(\widehat{\omega}: V \to V^*\\) defined by \\(\widehat{\omega}(v) = v\ \lrcorner\ \omega\\) is a linear isomorphism.

In order to understand symplectic geometry, it is necessary to understand symplectic forms on individual vector spaces.
