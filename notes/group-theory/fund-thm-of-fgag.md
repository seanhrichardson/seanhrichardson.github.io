## Fundamental Theorem of Finitely Generated Abelian Groups

#### Statement
Let $G$ be a finitely generated abelian group. Then, $G$ is isomorphic to the following unique expression
\\[G \cong \mathbb{Z}^{r} \times Z_{n_1} \times Z_{n_2} \times \cdots \times Z_{n_s}\\]
where $n_i \geq 2$, $n_{i+1} \mid n_{i}$ for all $i$, and $r \geq 0$.
