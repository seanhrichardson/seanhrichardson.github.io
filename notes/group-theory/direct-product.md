## Direct Product on Groups

#### Definition
Take two groups $(G, \circ)$ and $(H, \star)$. Now consider the set formed by the Cartesian product $G \times H$ together with the operation $(g,h) \cdot (g',h') = (g \circ g', h \star h')$. The resulting group is called the *direct product*.

#### Verification the Direct Product Forms a Group
The group properties of the direct product follow directly from the properties of the original groups. Showing associativity is straightforward manipulation using the associativity of $G$ and $H$. The identity is given by the pair of original identites $(1_G, 1_H)$, and the inverse of any element $(g,h)$ is constructed using the individual inverses $(g^{-1},h^{-1})$.
