## Group Actions

#### Definition
Given a group $G$ and a set $S$, a group action is a function $.: G \times S \rightarrow S$ such that:
* $1.s = s ~~ \forall s \in S$.
* $(ab).s = a.(b.s) ~~ \forall a,b \in G$ and $s \in S$. 

#### Examples
* A group $G$ acts on itself by left conjugation $g.x = gxg^{-1}$.
* For a group $G$ and a subset $A \subset G$, the normalizer $N_A(G)$ can act on $A$ by left conjugation $n.a = nan^{-1}$.
