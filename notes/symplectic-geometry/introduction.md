# Symplectic geometry introduction

## Hamiltonian \\(n\\)-body problem.

Consider the problem of mathematically modeling the planetary motion of the solar system. For this, consider \\(k\\) point masses  all gravitationally interacting with eachother with the goal of predicting the positions \\(\mathbf{q_1}(t), \cdots, \mathbf{q_k}(t) \in \mathbb{R}^3\\) and momentums \\(\mathbf{p_1}(t), \cdots, \mathbf{p_k}(t) \in \mathbb{R}^3\\) of these \\(k\\) particles over time. That is, all possible positions and momentums are encoded as points in the phase space \\((\mathbb{R}^3)^k \times (\mathbb{R}^3)^k\\) with coordinates \\((\mathbf{q_1}, \cdots, \mathbf{q_k}, \mathbf{p_1}, \cdots, \mathbf{p_k})\\). Equivalently, letting \\(n = 3k\\), we can consider the phase space \\(\mathbb{R}^{2n}\\) with coordinates \\((x^1, \cdots, x^n, \xi^1, \cdots, \xi^n)\\) encoding the positions and momentums by \\(\mathbf{q\_j} = (x\_{3j-2}, x\_{3j-1}, x\_{3j})\\) and \\(\mathbf{p\_j} = (\xi\_{3j-2}, \xi\_{3j-1}, \xi\_{3j})\\). The Hamiltonian equations from classical mechanics determine the evolution of the positions and momentums \\((x^1(t), \cdots, x^n(t), \xi^1(t), \cdots, \xi^n(t))\\) by
\\[
        \dot{x}^i = \frac{\partial H}{\partial \xi^i} 
        \quad \text{and} \quad
        \dot{\xi}^i = - \frac{\partial H}{\partial x^i}
\\]
where \\(H: \mathbb{R}^{2n} \to \mathbb{R}\\) is given by the sum \\(H(x^1, \cdots, x^n, \xi^1, \cdots, \xi^n) = V(x^1, \cdots, x^n) + K(\xi^1, \cdots, \xi^n)\\) of the potential and kinetic energy of the system. 

## Information of Hamiltonian Systems

Like the problem of modeling the solar system, many mechanical systems have phase space \\(\mathbb{R}^{2n}\\) with coordinates \\((x^1, \cdots, x^n, \xi^1, \cdots, \xi^n)\\) and the evolution is determined by two pieces of information.
<!--  -->
1. A function \\(H: \mathbb{R}^{2n} \to \mathbb{R}\\) on the phase space called the *Hamiltonian*.
2. The evolution rule given by
\\[
        \dot{x}^i = \frac{\partial H}{\partial \xi^i} 
        \quad \text{and} \quad
        \dot{\xi}^i = - \frac{\partial H}{\partial x^i}.
\\]

Equivalently, the evolution of the system is determined by the vector field corresponding to the above differential equations given by
\\[
    X_H = \sum_i \frac{\partial H}{\partial \xi^i} \partial_{x^i} - \frac{\partial H}{\partial x^i} \partial_{\xi^i}.
\\]
In particular, the evolution of the system is determined by the flow \\(\theta(t)\\) on the phase space \\(\mathbb{R}^{2n}\\) generated by \\(X_H\\). The data carried in the rule (2) can be equivalently encoded in the 2-form \\(\omega = \sum_{i} dx^i \wedge d\xi^i\\). Then the vector field \\(X_H\\) governing the flow is characterized by the equation
\\[
    X_H \lrcorner\ \omega = dH.
    \tag{\\(\star\\)}
    \label{eq:vf-rule}
\\]

**Exercise.** Verify the above equality and check this equality uniquely characterizes \\(X_H\\).

This observation allows us to study the flows of such mechanical systems in the following setting. We take a \\(2n\\)-dimensional manifold \\(N\\), some Hamiltonian \\(H: N \to \mathbb{R}\\), and some \\(2\\)-form \\(\omega\\), which we hope generated a vector field by the rule (\ref{eq:vf-rule}). However, this rule only defines a unique vector field if \\(\omega\\) is "nondegenerate" as defined below.

**Def (non-degenerate form).** A 2-form \\(\omega\\) on a \\(2n\\)-dimensional smooth manifold is called *nondegenerate* if the induced map \\(\widehat{\omega}_p: T\_p \to T^\*\_pN\\) defined by \\(v \mapsto v \lrcorner\ \omega_p\\) is an isomorphism for all \\(p \in N\\)

Furthermore, the \\(2\\)-form \\(\omega = \sum_{i} dx^i \wedge d\xi^i\\) that encodes this structure is also closed, so we are often interested in "symplectic forms" defined on "symplectic manifolds" defined as follows.

/\*todo: understand why closed is useful/necessary and include this in the motivation. For instance, can we still get a vector field and dynamics if the form isn't closed?\*

**Exercise.** Compute \\(d\left(\sum_{i} dx^i \wedge d\xi^i\right) = 0\\) to verify this form is closed.

**Def (symplectic form).** A *symplectic form* is a closed, nondegenerate 2-form \\(\omega\\) on a \\(2n\\)-dimensional smooth manifold.

**Def (symplectic manifold).** A *symplectic manifold* is a \\(2n\\)-dimensional smooth manifold \\(N\\) together with a particular choice of a symplectic 2-form \\(\omega\\) on \\(N\\).

Symplectic manifolds become particularly powerful when paired with a particular smooth Hamiltonian function \\(H: N \to \mathbb{R}\\) in which case we get a natural vector field \\(X_H\\) on \\(N\\) as discussed above determining the evolution of the phase space and such systems are the study of *symplectic geometry*.
