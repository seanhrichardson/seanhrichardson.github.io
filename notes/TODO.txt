PRIORITY:
- Manifolds, following manifolds class.
    - topology page (almost done)
- Dynamics
- PDES stuff that I want to learn
    - Sobolev spaces
    - Pseudodifferential operators
    - Elliptic regularity
- clean up all ongoing projects
    - Euler Lagrange (almost done)
    - forms motivation and wedge product pages (finish this when manifolds gets there)
    - heat equation motivation (almost done... add easier motivation and exercises to Einstein one.)
    - minimal surface equation motivation (almost done)
    - rigid body dynamics page
    - metric space continuity (done with proof)
    - wave equation (derivation and 1d basically done)
- Road to Schwarzschild
    - finish riemannian manifold page
    - finish geodesic page
    - finish sphere page
    - start tangent vectors...
    - special relatiivity (almost done)


SOON:
- distributions (not motovation, will think of that later).
- Riesz representation theorem
- Fourier series, Fourier transform, Pontryagin Duality
- Dirichlet problem

TECHNICAL:
- create engine for making mini-books.
- click dots in mathjax to display computation steps.
- allow for hover text over equals signs to explain steps in mathjax? ALthough also want to try and be mobile friendly...

FINISHED!
- tensor product page
- minecraft page
