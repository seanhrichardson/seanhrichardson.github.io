## Alternating Tensors

Given a vector space $V$ with no additional structure such as a dot product or norm, we have no notion of the length of a vector $v \in V$ or, more generally, the volume of a parallelotope in $V$ spanned by $v_1, \cdots, v_n$.

We are looking for multilinear maps $\omega \in L(V, \cdots, V)$ such that we can interpret $\omega(v^1, \cdots, v^n)$ as defining the weighted volume of the parallelotope spanned by $v^1, \cdots, v^n$.

/\*use linear transformation definition as in Prop 14.9 in lee... verify it is a vector space\*/

## Wedge Product

/\*work towards universal property...\*/
