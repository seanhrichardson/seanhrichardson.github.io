title: Exterior Derivative Motivation via Stoke's Theorem
---

/\*Perhap not the best motivation, but kind makes sense to me, so I'll jot the ideas down\*/

/\*can I formalize this into a meaningful result by defining some sort of "volume" operator that satisfies certain properties\*/

/\*"volume" is not the right word... more of a measure?\*/

The idea is to motivate the exterior derivative via Stoke's theorem. That is, given a $d$-form $\omega$ on an $n$-manifold $M$, this allows us to bestow a notion of volume on all $d$-submanifolds. The idea, then, is that we can also give some sense of volume to $d+1$-submanifolds with boundary by declaring its volume to be the volume of the boundary. Does this new sense of volume correspond to a $d+1$ form $d\omega$. If so, we require
\\[
    \int_{N} d\omega = \int_{\partial N} \omega
\\]
for all $d$-dimensional submanifolds $N$.
