## Complex Analysis Logic:

#### Basics:

* Complex numbers

* Complex functions

* Complex Differentiability

* Cauchy-Riemann Equations

* Assume Green's Theorem

* Green's Theorem \\(\implies\\) Cauchy's Theorem

* Cauchy's Theorem \\(\implies\\) Cauchy Integral Formula

* At some point: Cauchy's Integral Formula \\(\implies\\) Cauchy Estimates \\(\implies\\) Liouville's Theorem \\(\implies\\) Fundamental Theorem of Algebra.

#### Singularities:

* Types of singularities.

* Cauchy's Theorem \\(\implies\\) Residue Theorem

* Techniques to calcualte residues.

* At some point: Casorati-Weierstrass Theorem on essential singularities.

#### Harmonic Functions

#### Riemann Mapping Theorem

* Intuition: deforming wire into a disc.

* Montel's Theorem & Hurwitz Theorem & ... \\(\implies\\) Riemann Mapping Theorem

#### Monodromy, Montel, Picard.

* Monodromy Theorem

* Montel's Theorem

* Picard's Theorem

#### Mitlay-Leffler.

* Mitlayer Leffler Theorem

* Meromorphic functions are the fractional field of analytic functions.

#### Special Fuctions

* Gamma Function

* Zeta Function

#### Algebraic Curves

#### Riemann Surfaces

* Characterization of Riemann Surfaces.

#### Random stuff:

* Roche's Theorem (only introuce when needed?)

* Roche's Theorem \\(\implies\\) Hurwitz Theorem ("roots don't come out of nowhere")

* Open mapping theorem.

* Maximum modulus principle

* Schwarz Lemma

* Runge's Theorem
