## Complex Integration

/\*todo: define and mootivate complex integration\*/

/\*motivate with the desired property \\(\int_{[z_0,z_1]} c dz = (z_0 - z_1)c\\) (I think this is the best way... we will get visual intuition with Polya vector field later, but not intuition)\*/

/\*comment that holomorphic functions behave well under this integral\*/

/\*talk about parametrization:\*/
\\[\int_{\gamma} f(z) dz = \int_{t = 0}^1 \gamma'(t) f(\gamma(t))dt\\]

/\*talk about dividing integral\*/
\\[\int_{\gamma} f(z) dz = \int_{\gamma} f(z) dx + i\int_{\gamma} f(z) dy\\]

/\*talk about visual intuition via Polya vector field\*/

/\*mention that Polya V.F. makes it clear that holomorphic functions behave well under integral.\*/
