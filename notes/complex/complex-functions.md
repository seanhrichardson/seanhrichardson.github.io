## Complex Functions

Many familiar real functions can be written with only addition and multiplication through their Taylor series, and we know how to add and multiply complex numbers, thus we can often extend such functions to accept complex arguments. When extending functions such as \\(e^x\\), \\(\sin x\\), and \\(\cos x\\) to mappings \\(\mathbb{C} \to \mathbb{C}\\) of the complex plane in this way, extra structure and patterns emerge that allow us to better understand these functions. The study of this extra structure on extended functions is the field of *complex analysis*.

#### The exponential

One of the most important examples of extending functions to have complex arguments is given by the exponential function, which satisfies
\\[
    e^x = \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} \frac{x^k}{k!}
\\]
for all \\(x \in \mathbb{R}\\). We know how to add and multiply complex numbers and thus we can extend the definition of the exponential to the complex plane by defining for all \\(z \in \mathbb{C}\\) the function
\\[
    e^z := \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} \frac{z^k}{k!}
\\]
**Exercise.** Show that the above series converges for all \\(z \in \mathbb{C}\\) /\*using notion of convergence from \\(\mathbb{R}^2\\)\*/.
