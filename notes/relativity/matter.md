## Matter in Special Relativity

/\*outline:\*/

Note that the dynamics of isolated particles is such that they follow geodesics with metric \\(m\\). That is, the lagrangian is \\(L(x,v) = \frac{1}{2}\mathfrak{m}\_x(v,v)\\). However, for each individual particle, any Lagrangian of the form \\(L(x,v) = \frac{m}{2}\mathfrak{m}\_x(v,v)\\) would work for some \\(m\\). This \\(m\\) is called the *mass*. 

Then can use the relationship between Lagrangian and momentum (see Olsson pg, 102) to derive 4-momentum \\(\mathbf{p} = p\_i dx^i\\) for \\(p\_i = m v^i\\) for 4-momentum \\(v = v^i \partial\_i\\)

/\*from here can follow iva... (pg. 142)\*/

mass energy density:

follow iva... each observer should measure 
\\[
    \frac{\rho}{1-v^2}
\\]
for mass-energy-density of some dust-cloud that measures itself to have mass-energy-density \\(\rho\\).

Then... /\*todo\*/ the only tensor \\(T\\) such that
\\[
    T(\partial\_t, \partial\_t) = \frac{\rho}{1-v^2}
\\]
(i.e. returns the mass-energy computation of \\(\partial\_t\\)) is 
\\[
    T = \rho \mathfrak{m}(U, \cdot ) \mathfrak{m}(U, \cdot)
\\]
where \\(U\\) is the 4-velocity of the dust cloud.
