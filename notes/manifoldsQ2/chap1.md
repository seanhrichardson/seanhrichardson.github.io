## Chapter 1

**Lemma 1.10.** A manifold $M$ has a countable basis of precompact coordinate balls.
*proof.* By $M$ 2nd countable, there is a countable subcover of coordinate charts $(U_i, \varphi_i)$. We can reduce each neighborhood to countable precompact (verification uses $M$ Hausdorff) neighborhoods by taking the standard countable basis of $\mathbb{R}^n$ for ech $i$.
