#### Ring Theory
* Basic definitions
* $R/I$ integral domain $\iff$ $I$ prime
* $R/I$ field $\iff$ $I$ maximal
* Euclidean domain $\implies$ PID $\implies$ UFD
* Any proper ideal can be embedded into a maximal ideal


#### Field Theory
* Basic definitions
* Extension of algebraic element results
* We can extend a field to contain a root of some polynomial.
* Every field extends to an algebraically closed field.
