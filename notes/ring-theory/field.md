## Field

#### Definition
A commutative ring \\(R\\) is called a _field_ if every element has a multiplicative inverse.

#### Examples
* The rationals \\(\mathbb{Q}\\).
* The reals \\(\mathbb{R}\\).
* The complex numbers \\(\mathbb{C}\\).
* The integers modulo a prime \\(\mathbb{Z}_p\\).
* The set of all algebraic numbers.
* For any integral domain \\(R\\), we can define a corresponding [field of fractions](field-of-fractions.html).
* All examples of [ordered fields](ordered-field.html).
