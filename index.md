## About

Hello! I am Sean Richardson, an aspiring mathematician currently working as a math tutor for Saga Education. This coming fall of 2022, I am excited to begin Universiy of Washington's mathematics PhD program with the generous funding of NSF's Graduate Research Fellowship Program. I completed my undergraduate degree from Lewis & Clark college in Portland, Oregon with a major in mathematics & computer science with a second major in physics. Separate from mathematics, I am an avid runner and also enjoy biking, camping, and hiking.
