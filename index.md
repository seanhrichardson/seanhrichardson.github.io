# About

<!-- CHANGE... -->

Hello! I am Sean Richardson, a mathematics Ph.D. candidate at the University of Washington. I have a passion for teaching mathematics and help run the [UW Math Circle](https://sites.math.washington.edu/~mathcircle/circle/). My mathematics research interests lie in Differential Geometry, Dynamics, Microlocal Analysis, and Inverse Problems. I completed my undergraduate degree from Lewis & Clark college in Portland, Oregon with a major in mathematics & computer science with a second major in physics. Outside of mathematics, you might find me biking around Seattle or trail running.
