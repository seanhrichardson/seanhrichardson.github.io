**Goal:** Understand Yau's proof of the Calabi conjecture, which, according to wikipedia, is the following.

*Calabi Conjecture.* If M is a compact Kähler manifold with Kähler metric $g$ and Kähler form $\omega$ and $R$ is any $(1,1)$-form representing the manifold's first Chern class, then there exists a unique Kähler metric $\widetilde{g}$ on $M$ with Kähler form $\widetilde{\omega}$ such that $\omega$ and $\widetilde{\omega}$ represent the same class in cohomology $H^2(M,\mathbb{R})$ and the Ricci form of $\widetilde{\omega}$ is $R$.

Before attempting the proof, I must first thoroughly understand all pieces of the statement. In paticular,

* What is a Kähler manifold, a Kähler metric, and a Kähler form?
* What is the "first Chern class".
* What is a Ricci form?
* Additionally, I need to properly understand cohomology as this was rushed at the end of the manifolds sequence.

Next, I would like to understand some significance and motivation behind the Calabi conjecture, which, after brief googling, involves GR. Ideally, get some intuition behind the statement before diving into the technicalities.

Tomorrow I'll review the relevant chapters in Lee's ITM and ISM so that I properly understand cohomology.
