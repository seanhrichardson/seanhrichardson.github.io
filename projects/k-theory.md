## Expository Thesis on Topological K-Theory

This expository thesis aims to make topological K-Theory accessible to undergraduates, assuming only background in introductory linear algebra and basic ring theory. I completed this thesis at Lewis & Clark college my last year as an undergraduate under advisor Professor Iva Stavrov. The document gives background in category theory, modules and semirings, and topology. Then, the document describes vector bundles and the definition of K-Theory before proceeding into the cohomology theory and the application to division algebras.
