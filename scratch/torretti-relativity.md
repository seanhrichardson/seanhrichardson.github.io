## Notes on Relativity and Geometry by Torretti

### Chapter 1

* According to Newton, the task of "natural philosophy" is to find the forces of nature by studying phenomenon, and using these forces to infer the remaining phenomenon.
* Newtonian Space: uses Euclidean space as the home for objects.
* Newtonian time
* **Rigid frame**: A set of 4 or more non-coplanar points in Euclidean space.
* Each rigid frame \\(F\\) defines a unique "relative space" \\(S_F\\). We can assign coordinates in the relative space \\(S_F\\).
* Neumann claims we must have an "alpha body", an absolute rigid frame, for Newton's theory to be valid. Note that if such a frame exists, then any other frame moving at a constant velocity to the alpha body is just as good, giving non-uniqueness of the alpha body.
* Indeed, we can verify the above point by mathematically mapping the position and taking the derivative. In particular, if a particle \\(\alpha\\) moves with constant velocity **w** in an inertial frame \\(F\\), then it moves with constant velocity \\(f_{0}(\dot{\mathbf{r}}(t))+\mathbf{v}\\) in a seperate frame \\(F'\\) where **v** is the velocity of F as observed from F', and \\(f_{0}: S_F \mapsto S_F'\\) is an isomorphism of vector spaces at time 0 that translates the velocity vectors between the two coordinate systems.
* Note that we can distinguish between an inertial and accelerating reference frame using Newton's third law: if a particle stationary with respect to an accelerating reference frame, you will observe a net momentum change on other objects that cannot be accounted for. _Note that in the case of a reference frame accelerating from gravity, the physics is nearly identical to an inertial frame with the momentum change of the gravitational body being the only indication._
