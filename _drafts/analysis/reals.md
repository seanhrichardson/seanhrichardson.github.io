## Real Numbers
#### Introduction
/\*Call real numbers "all numbers on the number line" or "corresponds to quantities such as distance, time, weight, (preferably something that includes negatives..)"\*/

/\*Introduce notation \\(\mathbb{R}\\) and \\(\mathbb{Q}\\) here somewhere\*/

/\*Give axioms of \\(\mathbb{R}\\) here and give explicit construction in the supplements... explain this approach to the reader\*/

/\*Use notation \\(\mathbf{R}\\) for informal discussion of properties and for "number line numbers, etc." then later introduce notation \\(\mathbb{R}\\) for formal definition. Then emphasize we hope \\(\mathbb{R}\\) is \\(\mathbf{R}\\)\*/

/\*i.e. trying to model \\(\mathbf{R}\\)\*/.

#### Properties of the Real Numbers
/\*Some things we know about the reals\*/

**Addition and Multiplication.** We can add and multiply real numbers in the way we are used to! The familiar properties of addition and multiplication are listed below.
1. Addition is associative: \\(x+(y+z) = (x+y)+z\\).
1. There is a number \\(0\\) such that \\(x+0 = x = 0+x\\).
1. Every number \\(x\\) has a negation \\(-x\\) such that \\(x+(-x)=0\\).
1. Addition is commutative: \\(x+y=y+x\\).
1. Multiplication is associative: \\(x(yz) = (xy)z\\).
1. There is a number \\(1\\) such that \\(1 \cdot x = x\\).
1. Every number \\(x\\) has a reciprocal \\(x^{-1}\\) such that \\(xx^{-1} = 1 = x^{-1}x\\).
1. Multiplication distributes over addition: \\((x+y)z = xz+yz\\).
1. Multiplication is commutative: \\(xy=yx\\).

Note that the rational numbers \\(\mathbb{Q}\\) also have addition and multiplication that satisfy the properties listed above. Importantly, the rational numbers are *closed* under addition and multiplication: adding two rational numbers is still rational and multiplying two rationals numbers is still rational.

Any collection of numbers (such as \\(\mathbb{Q}\\) and \\(\mathbb{R}\\)) that are closed under addition and multiplication operations satisfying the above listed properties is called a *field*.

**Less Than and Greater Than.** Given any two real numbers $x$ and $y$, less than and greater than behave as we are used to.
1. Exactly one of the following is true: "$x<y$", "$x>y$", "$x=y$".
1. If $x<y$ and $y<z$, then $x<z$.
1. If $x<y$, then $x+z<y+z$.
1. If $x>0$ and $y>0$, then $xy > 0$.
 
Note the rational numbers also have greater than or less than satisfying the properties above. Any field of numbers with $>$ and $<$ satisfying the above is called an *ordered field*.

**Contains Rationals.**
/\*Explain what containing the rationals means here... carries over operations and ordering.\*/

**Least Upper Bound Property.**

/\*motivate axioms here... study the reals, compare to rationals, give necessary defs etc, provide pictures and animations, etc.\*/

#### Axioms of the Reals
We take the following to be the axioms of the *real numbers*, denoted \\(\mathbb{R}\\).
1. \\(\mathbb{R}\\) is an ordered field.
1. \\(\mathbb{R}\\) contains the rationals $\mathbb{Q}$ as a subfield.
1. \\(\mathbb{R}\\) has the least upper bound property.

#### Consequences of the Axioms
