*Make this part as brief and intuitive as possible*
## From Natural to Complex Numbers

#### Naturals to Integers

* Intuition: adding in additive inverses
* Construction: equivalences classes of pairs

#### Integers to Rationals

* Intuition: adding in multiplicative inverses.
* Construction: equivalences classes of pairs

#### Rationals to Reals

* Intuition: adding in limit points
* Construction: equivalence classes of Cauchy sequences with respect to $\\{p_n\\} \sim \\{q_n\\}$ if $\|p_n-q_m\| \to 0$ (note: this does not depend on $\mathbb{R}$).
* Show can define $+$ and $\times$

#### Reals to Complexes

*Adding in solutions to polynomial equations*
